# Material overrides

Hybrid Renderer V2 enables you to override the property values of various HDRP and URP material properties. It also enables you to override material properties for custom Shader Graphs. There are two ways to do this, either:

- [Using C#/Burst code](material-overrides-code.md)
- [Using the Material Override Asset](material-overrides-asset.md)

## Sample scenes

Hybrid Renderer provides sample scenes to show you material overrides using both the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). For information on where to download the samples from, see [Sample Projects](sample-projects.md).

The paths to the per-render pipeline sample scenes are as follows:

- **HDRP**: **HybridHDRPSamples > SampleScenes > MaterialOverridesSample**
- **URP**: **HybridURPSamples > SampleScenes > MaterialOverridesSample**
