# Hybrid Renderer

![](images/HybridRendererSplash.png)

Hybrid Renderer provides systems and components for rendering [ECS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest) entities. Hybrid Renderer is not a render pipeline: it is a system that collects the data necessary for rendering ECS entities, and sends this data to Unity's existing rendering architecture.

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) are responsible for authoring the content and defining the rendering passes.

DOTS technology is in preview. If your Project aims to be production ready in 2021, the GameObject-based technology stack is much more suitable.

## Requirements
