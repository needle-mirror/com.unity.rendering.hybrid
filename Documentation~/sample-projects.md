# Sample projects

To explore more use cases of the Hybrid Render, the **EntityComponentSystemSamples** repository contains various samples.

This repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples) on Unity Technology's GitHub.

When you clone the Project's repository, make sure to use git or a git client. This is because if you use the Green button on the GitHub website, it does not download all the Assets.

The Hybrid Renderer sample projects can be found at:

- **HDRP**: [HybridHDRPSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/HybridHDRPSamples)
- **URP**: [HybridURPSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/HybridURPSamples)

Project folder structure:

- **SampleScenes**: Contains all sample scenes, showcasing the supported features.
- **StressTestScenes**: Contains stress test scenes for benchmarking.
- **Tests**: Graphics tests (for image comparisons).

Sample projects use Hybrid Renderer V2 and require Unity 2020.2.3f1 or later and version 10.2.2 or later of the HDRP and URP packages.
