# Getting started

Prior to the version 0.14, the Hybrid Renderer package contained two versions of Hybrid Renderer. 
This is no longer the case. As of the version 0.14, Hybrid Renderer V1 has been removed and the package now only contains Hybrid Renderer V2. 
If you still want to use Hybrid Renderer V1, you should use Hybrid Renderer version 0.13 or older.

- For information about SRP feature support, see [Hybrid Renderer versions](hybrid-renderer-versions.md).
- For information about which versions support which render pipeline and Unity versions, see [Requirements and compatibility](requirements-and-compatibility.md).

When you know which version of Hybrid Renderer you want to use and which render pipeline you want to use it with, see [Installing Hybrid Renderer](creating-a-new-hybrid-renderer-project.md) for information on how to create and set up your project.
